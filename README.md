# B-Tree
B-Tree, the indexing tree of Databases.

## Download, and Use the Makefile to compile
$ make

### To run program:
$ ./BTree 

#### Description/Goals

The B-Tree implemented here is the basic structure of a B-Tree. It uses integers as keys. Running this program will show you average times for insertion,search, and deletion.
The future plans in this B-Tree is to implement disk I/O of each node, and eventually make a branch for a B+Tree.
